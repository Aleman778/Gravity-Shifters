This is my entry for the Bigmode Game Jam 2023. The theme for this jam is **Mode** which is essentially the gravity switching mechanic. In this strange world, the player and enemies can have different gravitational modes. There is normal gravity which works like normal you are pulled downwards to the ground, and there is inverted gravity which pulls you upwards to the ceiling.
